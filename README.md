MTA Notepad++ - Syntax Highlighting & Auto Completion
==============

mta-npp is how you can get Notepad++ syntax highlighting and auto completion for MTA-Lua, with all it's functions and parameters.

N++ is highly customizable, you can add your own languages with syntax highlighting and auto completion. 

There are currently three files in the repo:

- mtalua-lang-import.xml > The file to import in the user defined language page to get the syntax highlighting
- MTA-Lua.xml > The auto completion file
- functions.txt > This is a file used to get the arguments, it's useless for you

Steps
-----

1. Open Notepad++ > Language > Define your language...
2. Import > Select mtalua-lang-import.xml (Make sure from now on that the MTA-Lua language is always selected for Lua files.
3. Copy MTA-Lua.xml to your Notepad++ directory "Notepad++/plugins/APIs" (Usually in C:/Program Files)
